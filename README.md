# odin-recipes
Here I have created a homepage and added three pages to the site that can be navigated from the homepage. Images folder was created and added images there. The content on each page is a recipe with an image, an unordered list of ingredients, and an ordered list of cooking steps. This project so far contains four pages of html only as of 10/16/23.
